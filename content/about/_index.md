title: About me
---

My name is Kolton Bodnovich and I'm currently living in Cleveland, Ohio. 

I recently earned my JD/MBA from Ohio State and since then I have been learning R programming. What initially started as a goal to learn a single language, R programming, has expanded to include other langauges and technologies including HTML, CSS, javascript, HTMLwidgets, github, Markdown and Hugo. In addition to having a background in law, business and coding, I also have a Six Sigma Green Belt. 

I thoroughly enjoy learning new things and combining knowledge from different domains to come up with creative solutions the world has never seen before. I also enjoy crafting and making tangible stuff using whatever materials (or machines) are close at hand.

This site is a collection of some of the projects I worked on during graduate school and   summer internships, as well as some self-guided projects[^site]. I hope that after viewing my portfolio you will have a better idea of who I am and what I can do.
