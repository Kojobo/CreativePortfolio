title: About me
---

My name is Kolton Bodnovich and I'm currently living in Cleveland, Ohio. 

I recently earned my JD/MBA from Ohio State and since then I have been learning R programming. 

What initially started as a goal to learn a single language, R programming, has expanded to include other langauges and technologies. Some of those languages include HTML, CSS, javascript, HTMLwidgets, github, and others. 

This site is a collection of some of the projects I worked on during graduate school and   summer internships, as well as some self-guided projects. 

This portfolio was made using RStudio, along with GitHub and Hugo.
