A six sigma project I completed to earn my Green belt. 

<!--more-->

In Spring 2019 I collaborated with a team of fellow MBA students and Abercrombie & Fitch associates to complete a six sigma project and earn my green belt. The main focus of the project was to implement the DMAIC framework to reduce the occurrence of machine errors in the main distribution center's outbound packaging process. Improving machine performance reduced the need for human intervention and enabled employees to focus on value added activities.

The first task for our team was to observe the entire process for receiving, sorting, packaging, and shipping SKUs out to A&F Branches across the country. After observing each of these steps, we created a work flow diagram to document each phase in the process.
