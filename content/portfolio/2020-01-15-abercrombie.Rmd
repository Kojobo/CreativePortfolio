This past spring I worked with a team of MBA students and Abercrombie & Fitch associates in the company's main distribution center. The main focus of the project was to implement the DMAIC framework to reduce the occurrence of machine errors in the outbound packaging process. Improving machine performance reduced the need for human intervention and enabled employees to focus on value added activities.
