Cool like kipchoge - because my little brother's favorite runner is Eliud Kipchoge

I had no idea, and didn't plan for this to happen, but the night before the Chicago Marathon, Kipchoge became the first human in history to run a marathon in under 2 hours. This made my sign even more relevant and spectators came up and asked to take pictures with my sign during the race. 

A few weeks later, the official instagram account for the mararthon posted a story of their favorite signs from that year's race. MY SIGN was the first post on their story! 

Kinda bummed that they never gave me credit for making the sign (a simple shoutout would have been more than enough), but I'm still super stoked to have been the first sign chosen by the official marathon account that has hundreds of thousands of followers.
