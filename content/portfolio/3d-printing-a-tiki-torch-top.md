Designing and printing a replacement lid for my brother's tiki torches using my iPad and Ender 3 Pro.

<!--more-->

Earlier this month my brother, Karson, asked if I could use my new 3D printer to make a few tiki-torch lids because some of his were blown away during a storm. It seemed like a simple print to design - just an open ended cylinder - so I agreed to try making some *tiki-tops* for him. Karson came to visit from Chicago shortly after making his request, and he brought a tiki-torch canister/tiki-top so that I could get accurate dimensions for my design.

The most important elements of this design were getting the inner diameter of the lid just right, and including something that you could attach a string to. I went through multiple iterations and designs until I landed on one that satisfied Karson. I used an app on my iPad called **Shapr3D** to create the designs for the tiki-tops.

### Tiki-Tops 1 through 4

Tiki-Tops 1-4 were mainly attempts to find the correct diameter of the inside of lids so that it fit snuggly over the wick-holder. The tops needed to be snug around the base because that made it harder for them to get blown off.

- *Tiki 1* was too wide, but only by a couple of milimeters.
- *Tiki 2's* design was made by scaling down *Tiki 1* using my [^slicing software] on my HP laptop. I didn't know the best proportion to use for scaling, so I guessed. My guess was slightly too high because *Tiki 2* was too narrow and wouldn't fit over the wick-base. 
- To get the design for *Tiki 3*, I went back to the drawing board (my iPad) and drew another cap from scratch. *Tiki 3* had inner radius slightly larger than *Tiki 2's*, and made the outer radius 2 mm longer,    

[^slicing software]: I used Creality3D's slicing software for this project, but I have recently converted to using Ultimaker's *Cura* for all my slicing needs.
