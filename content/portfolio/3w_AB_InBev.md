In 2017 my team made it to the final round of the Anheuser Busch InBev case competition.

The challenge for our team was to evaluate six different renewable energy projects and determine which project was the best choice to help AB InBev achieve its goal of using 100% rewewable energy by 2025. 

We were given a spreadsheet with various pieces of information for each project. Of the six projects, three were solar powered, and three were wind powered. My initial task for the team was to evaluate the contract terms for each of the projects, and to conduct research to find any incentive programs created by state or federal governments. 

Initially I struggled to keep information organized because there was a lot of data for each project. I decided to create a logo for each of the projects along with a specific color so that it would be easier to mentally associate individual projects with their respective information.

The members of my team loved the logos and wanted to incorporate them throughout our presentation. We added the logos, and updated our charts to incorporate my design.

My team was selected from a dozen other teams to represent Ohio State Fisher College of Business in the final round of the competition in New York City where we presented our recommendation to AB InBev executives.In the final round we competed against teams from over 40 business schools from around the country. 

I also created graphics to show the different phases of the renewable energy purchasing process.
