In addition to making graphics, I like to make other things as well. 

Here are a few things that I've made. 

### Wall Art

### Wedding Backdrop

In September 2019, my mom and I made this backdrop for a family wedding. The flowers were cut using a Cricut and are made out of cardstock and old jewelry.

### Baby Shower Centerpieces 

In October 2019, my mom and I made the centerpieces for a family baby shower. The 'diaper cakes' were adorned with signs and paper roses that I made from cardstock cut using the cricut.
