This is a graphic I made to help me learn RGB color codes.

I made this graphic while trying to learn RGB and hexadecimal color codes. There were similar graphics available online, but all of them had the Red, Blue, and Green on chart, rather than being separated into three charts. This made it difficult to see the relationship between the three colors and how they combined to create additional colors on the spectrum.
