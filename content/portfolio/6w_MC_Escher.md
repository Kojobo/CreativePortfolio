I made some signs for the 2019 Chicago Marathon.

In 2019, my brother ran in the Chicago Marathon. I made some signs for me and my family so that he could spot us in the crowd during the race. After the race, one of my signs was chosen by the Chicago Marathon instagram account as one of the favorite signs of Chicago Marathon.  

I made this sign because Eliud Kipchoge is my brother's all-time favorite runner. The sign was especially popular because the night before the Chicago Marathon, Kipchoge made history by becoming the first person to finish a marathon in under 2 hours. 


Here is a picture of me holding the sign in China Town. (it was very early)

Here is a picture of the sign from the Chicago Marathon's instagram page.

The marathon itself was a fun experience, but it was even more exciting to be featured on the official Chicago Marathon's instagram account, which has nearly 100K followers from all around the world.
