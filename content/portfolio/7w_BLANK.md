In law school I took a Mergers & Acquisitions class. The book we used contained graphics that visualized the main types of transactions that we would be studying that semester. Below are some examples of modernized graphics that I believe make it easier to understand what's going on in these transactions. 

### Basic Merger Between Two Parties: Stock for Stock Transaction 

This is the simplest form a merger can take. Company A (Red) and Company B (Blue) merger together into a single entity when Company A trades shares of its stock with the Shareholders of Company B. The shares of Company B, as well as the entity itself, are extinguished. In exchange for the shares of A stock received, Company B gives Company A all of its Assets and Liabilities. After the transaction, a single corporation exists (Purple), Company B's shareholders are now shareholders in Company A, and the Assets and Liabilities of both companies are combined.
