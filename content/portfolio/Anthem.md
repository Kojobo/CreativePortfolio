Some projects from when I interned as an Internal Consultant in Denver with Anthem

### Main Project: Process Maps for Large Group Sales

My main project at Anthem was to help the internal consulting team with making end to end process maps for the sales processes in each state. These maps were made using Microsoft Visio and Blueworks Live. After these processes were mapped out, they would be assessed and a single process would be created to accomodate the implementation of the new Salesforce.com 2.0 system the company was adopting. 

Unfortunately, these maps contained a lot of propietary information, so I am not allowed to post them. 


### Side Project: Patient Journey Maps

These are snapshots of timelines I created for patient experiences that required executive intervention. Essentially, these were events where the customer became so frustrated that they sent a complaint directly to Anthem's CEO. These journey maps were created for the CEO's team to figure out why the problem wasn't addressed before it became an 'escalated event'. The timelines also include "Root Cause", "Impact", and "Prevention" sections to provide a more condensed summary of the problem to the CEO and her team. 

> These timelines contained sensitive information, so the names of customers and employees have been covered.
