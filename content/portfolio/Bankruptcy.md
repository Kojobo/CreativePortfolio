An updated report on Chapter 7 Bankruptcy in the US from 2001-2018

In law school I completed a course called "Debtor Creditor Law" which focused a great deal on the  bankruptcy system in the United States. 

While conducting research for an assignment in this class, I came across a wealth of bankruptcy data on the Department of Justice's website. In addition to the data, there was also a report published in 2001 by the DOJ that provided a summary of bankruptcy in the US from 1994 - 2000.

The DOJ has not published a similar report since 2001, but the Department has bankruptcy data from 2000 to the present readily available on their website.

This project was an attempt to use R programming to recreate the same report published by the DOJ in 2001, only this version would cover bankruptcy from 2001 - 2018 rather than 1994-2000.
