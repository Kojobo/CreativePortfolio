A growing list of books I've been reading this summer. 

<!--more--> 

I am a **massive** fan of books. Period. 

I'm not the sort of person who completely reads a book from cover to cover before starting another book. Instead, I tend to *hop around* between multiple books simultaneaously and what I'm reading at any given time is based primarily on the current mood or vibe I'm looking for

These are some of the books that I've picked up this summer, and I fully expect this list to expand throughout the season.

### OPT ART: From Mathematical Optimization to Visual Design - Robert Bosch 

I recently went into a Barnes and Noble for the first time in months and stumbled across this book in the math section. That author uses advanced mathmematics to design unique iterations of artwork and walks the read through the steps to create your own. One program he uses applies the *Traveling Salesman* problem to connect a series of points to optimize whatever parameters to decide to incorporate. 

This was one of the few books this summer that I actually read cover to cover before moving on to different book because I found it so fascinating. I would love to learn and use the software that he mentions in this book, but sadly some of the technology is not free and I no longer qualify for the free student trial.
