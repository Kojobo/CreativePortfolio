The inspiration for this piece came from a post I saw on instagram. I went through many iterations until settling on the look of the final product.

#### Original Post

I wanted to make something similar using paper. Initially I used a ruler and exacto knife to try and cut these very thin strips. I ultimately switched over to using a Cricut to do the cutting because it can cut *much* faster and *much* more precise that I can by hand. 

#### Design based on original post

I recreated the design using Cricut design studio and the original color scheme.

#### Altered design with new color scheme

Once I figured out how the oginal creator achieved the *MC Escher effect* with the prisms I went and modified the design to make it my own. I added a few more layers and switched from a monocromatic color scheme to a rainbow scheme.

I really liked how this turned out, but it still was missing something. I determined that there needed to be some darker surfaces for the prisms to appear three dimensional.

This really made the design pop. 

#### More tweaks

Now that I had achieved the 3D effect I needed to decide whether red should be the middle color, or purple.

I liked purple in the center more than red. 

After finalizing the design, I used the Cricut to cut all of the little strips out of colored cardstock. I then assembled the pieces onto a difference piece of cardstock using rubber cement. 

Once the pieces with firmly set in place, I needed to decide on the background color. I asked a few friends whether they liked the 'pearl' or black background better - there was not a clear consensus.

#### Final Product

I ultimately went with the black background because I had a of posterboard that was large enough for the piece. (if I wanted to use the pearl I would have had to attach two pieces together, and I didn't want there to be a 'seem') The posterboard also added support so I could hang it on the wall without worrying about it getting damaged. It's currently hanging in the room I use at home as an office/studio.
