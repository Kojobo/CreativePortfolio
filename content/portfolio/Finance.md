This is a concept for something that could be used in finance, but in reality could be used to represent a number of different disciplines. Bascically the green sphere represents the 'good assets' someone has, and the red represents the 'bad'. In finance, the red assets might be considered debt or some other monetary obligation a company has. I haven't pursued this concept much beyond the initial mock-up because in my head I wanted them to be animated and I'm still learning to make animations. In the animated version, the spere would move along some axis depicting time, and as the sphere moved it would grow or shrink to represent the company adding or losing assets.
