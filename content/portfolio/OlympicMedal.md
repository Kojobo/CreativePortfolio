This is my design concept for the Winter Olympics. But I might modify it to be for the summer olympics..

I initially began this design for a competition hosted by the Youth Winter Olympics in Lusanne. Unfortunately, due to the demands of law school, I was unable to finish the design before the competition deadline. However, I plan to complete my design and hopefully submit it for a future competition, maybe even for the regular adult olympics. 

The design started from a symbol in sacred geometry called the "Seed of life". I wanted to take this concept and combine it with the geometric qualities of a snowflake (because winter)
