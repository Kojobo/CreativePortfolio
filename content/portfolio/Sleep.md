I took a Data Visualization class in Business school - our first assignment was to track our sleep schedule for 7 days and visualize it on a 6 x 4 notecard.

This was my first assignment for my Data Visualization class in business school. Our task was to record our sleep schedule for a week and create a graphic that visualizes that information on a 6x4 notecard. The design needed to show the hours you were awake, and the hours you weren't. 

| My professor asked to keep my notecard, so I remade the visual in my sketchbook using the same dimensions.

I played with a few different ideas before finally settling on the cascading ribbon idea. The hardest part about this decision was figuring out how to draw a spiraling ribbon in three dimensions.  

I start with what looks like a sin wave and colored certain periods of the wave dependent on whether the time was AM or PM.

Another attempt at a cascading ribbon, this time with a reference grid included. At this point I still did not understand the shape you needed to draw to give the appearance of a 3D ribbon.

Instead of using a curve, I went with a straight strip. From there I was able to figure out that you need to curve both the 'front' and 'back' sections upwards, and at the same angle.

I liked this concept, where the cresent shaped area represents your sleep hours and the inset circle represented your time awake. I decided not to use it because the cresent shape only represented amount of sleep, but it did not indicate *when* you were asleep. For example, you could take a 2 hours nap in the afternoon, but this design wouldn't represent that information. Another reason why I didn't choose this design was because the geometry required to determine the size and position of each circle was a bit daunting.

At this point I've spaced out the ribbon so that each hour and each day is allotted the same space on the card.
