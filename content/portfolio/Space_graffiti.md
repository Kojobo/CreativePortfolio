This is a project I did with my friend Jo. We saw a youtube video of someone using this particular spray paint technique for making galaxies and other space themed stuff. Our only constraint was that we had to use whatever leftover paint we had in our garage. We did end up running to home depot to buy some black paint, and maybe one or two more colors, but enerything else came from the garage. 

Johanna and I made dozens of planets and probably went through propbably 25 feet of newspaper-paper while making them. (we used newspapers as our canvas - my family still got the Plain Dealer delievered back then) Sadly, many of our creations are no longer around; they were either thrown away or somehow destroyed. Honestly, we tossed many of them ourselves because they were practice planets.

Fortunately, I saved my favorite. This was one of the last 'planet-scapes' I had made and, in *my* opinion, it was the best creation of the evening. Though, Jo will tell you that *her* planets were the best.

The smaller planets were made using an easier technique than the largest planet. Basically you spray down a single color for the base, and then lightly spray a second layer with a different color. Then you ruffle up the paint a bit with some newspaper and *voila* - planet.

Adding the shading to one edge of the planet was *nearly impossible* to nail down just right. Many of our first planets had solid black lines instead of a graceful, **even** shadow. You'll notice on the orange planet thaat it's shadaw is a *bit* heavy handed, but still very even. You'll also notice that the largest planet has almost no shadow. This is because I was afraid to get too close with the black paint and ruin this planet. I gave it just a *hint* of shade and that was fine with me. 

It was also a challenge making the stars. We bought glow in the dark paint for this, but it was more of a clear paint and didn't stand out at all on the black paint. Luckily we had some white paint in the garage; we mainly used this for the stars.

This planet was hard for two reasons. First - I was using more than one color for the base. Second - I was adding stripes. 

Adding more colors was difficult because getting six even lines of paint into a neat, compact row is hard to do when using spraypaint. Also, we only had a *tiny* amount of purple and blue left, so I wasn't able to take many *practice* runs. 

Adding the stripes makes the planet look more like jupiter and less like Neptune. It's difficult because it requires you to have a bit more control over the newspaper as you ruffle up the paint. You need to make a single stroke across the entire space of the planet, trying to avoid smearing and smudges along the way.

The one thing I don't like about this project is the smears around the edges of the planets. Those came from the various lids, frisbees, pie plates etc. that we used as stencils for our planets. These household objects made great stencils, but they were very difficult to remove from the paper because they didn't have handles. If I ever get the chance to make planets like this again, I would make sure that my stencils had firm handles so that they could be removed without messing up the planet's edges. I also wouldn't bother buying glow-in-the-dark paint.
