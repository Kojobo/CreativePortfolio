Got a bunch of stuff you need to do but aren't sure where to start? The This-OR-That-inator is here to help.

Throughout grad school I regularly found myself in a situation where it felt like I had a million things to do but I couldn't figure out which thing to do first.

> Example of typical scenario: 
> Do I start some laundry, load the dishwasher, read for my Tax law class, read for my Bankruptcy law class, work on my data viz assigment, or work on my six sigma project.  
> Do I do my Crim Law reading? or Civ Pro? or Property?..or Contracts?...or..torts?

I would put considerable time and effort into ranking the items on my to-do list in order of most-ugent to least-urgent. Many times I was unable to come to a reasonable conclusion and wound up doing nothing on my list instead.

I decided to take my handwritten to do list and cut it into strips so that each task was on its own strip. I folded the slips, put them in a bowl, shook the bowl around a bit, then picked one of the slips out. Whatever task I picked was the task I had to work on. I used this method for most of my four years in graduate school, though I didn't always use a bowl (any hat or container will do). 

I had to use this system while visiting my brother in Chicago. I asked him if he had some scissors and a hat. He asked why. I explained what I was about to do. He thought it was hilarious. He said he could definitely use the process to help him with all of his work assignments (He is a 'Level 3 CFA Candidate' - aka he fucks with finance real hard and most of his work is done using excel). He was a big fan of this system from the get-go; he loved picking out the slips, even when all of the tasks were for me to complete. 

Eventually I came up with the idea of putting the slips into their own little pod, and then using a BINGO roller to shuffle the pods around until one eventually popped out. This idea was immediately discontinued once I saw the price for bingo rollers (they're expensive, and I was a broke grad student). 

Instead of buying a BINGO roller I decided to make my own using an empty tide pod container, shoebox, and some wire hangers. I also bought 50 - 1 inch 'acorn pods' online for like a dollar.

The initial prototype worked but it wasn't very asthetically pleasing, so I covered it with cardstock and construction paper to make it pretty.

A shoebox was an ok base for the machine, but it didn't provide the support I was looking for in the foundation for the tumbler. And even after covering the base with black paper you could still tell that it was a shoebox. Eventually I designed and built an much better base. It had the necessary strength AND it looked pretty slick as well.
