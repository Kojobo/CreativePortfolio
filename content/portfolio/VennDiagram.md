Can you make a Venn Diagram with more than 3 circles? What about a shape other than a circle? 

<!--more-->

The inspiration for this project came from my one of Strategy case studies in business school. Our professor began the case study by using a venn diagram to compare/contrast two subjects involved in the case we were reading. Eventually, a third party entered the mix so our professor drew an additional circle that overlapped with the two circles in the original diagram. Pretty soon a fourth party got involved but my professor said that we had to switch over to a different diagram because it was impossible to make a Venn Diagram using more than 3 circles. 

### Challenging a Venn Diagram's 3-Circle Limit (2D)

At first I didnt believe him, because I could picture 4 overlapping circles in my head and everything seemed to work fine. But when I actually drew the figure I realized that there were some group interactions that weren't present. More specifically, the top left circle and the bottom right circle in the figure below do not have a section where only those shapes share an interection.

Every intersection between these two groups also includes an intersection with one or both of the remaining two groups. 

### Exploring alternative shapes. (2D)
In addition to circles, I also gave triangles, rectangles, and squares a try.

### Challenging a Venn Diagram's 3-Circle Limit (3D)

My next thought was that maybe if you add another dimension and convert the diagram from 2D into 3D, then the 3-circle limitation would no longer apply. I started with the 2D drawing of a 4 circle venn diagram and created solids for the outermost sections.

Then I moved one level inward and created objects to represent these intersections.

This is what they look like without the outer level.

I did the same thing for the third level.

And finally I created a solid for the middle intersection.
