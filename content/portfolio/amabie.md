I came across this 'challenge' while parousing through IDEO's blog (The Octopus) and thought it would be fun to design a supernatural entity with a few constraints tied in. 

The article is about a mythical sea creature from Japanese folklore, named Amabie. The 'challenge' element of this story is to come up with an idea for what Amabie looks like, provided a list of three constraints. The rules are that your Amabie must include: 

1. A Beak
2. Long-Hair
3. Fin-like Wings

> "The rest is up to the artist" 

After reading the instructions, I immediately started working on my Amabie design; I waited to read the rest of the article until *after* I finished my design, because I thought that the designers creations might unintentionally influence my Amabie's design. 

I'm so glad that I did this. 
Here is my design.

I spent a long time debating the ins and outs of each of these parameters. 

## A Beak

I started with the beak. I used a cool-color palette because Amabie is a creature of the sea. I wanted the beak to be a bit *loud*, like a toucan's, so I used more of a neon/electric palette and decided on purple as the base color. I like how it turned out, but it also kinda reminds me of a Wild Berry Poptart.

I also like that the pattern gives the beak a more of a 3D vibe.

I also considered squid beaks for a moment, instead of a bird beak, but those are mainly internal so you wouldn't be able to see it. 

I think if I were to make Amabie again I might follow through with the squid beak and go with more of a cephalapod vibe. I could draw something similar to a squid, and include the other parameters without making the beak expressly visible, the way you might see a normal squid. I didn't think of that at first,but now that I'm thinking about it again while typing this post I'm having the realization that just because I have something doesn't mean that it *must* been seen or on display. I have a brain, but you can't see it; Amabie can have a beak, and we don't have to see it to believe it. 

## The Eye

This wasn't one of the requirements, but I knew I wanted to make the eye a main feature in the design because Amabie is able to see into the future. I used a fisheye as a reference, but instead of having giant black center, I made it absurdly large, and white to somewhat allude to Amabie's power to see the future. Also, white is usually seen more as the **good** color when compared to black, and Amabie sounds like a chill entity that promotes good rather than evil. The Iris is mainly blue, but its got a little bit of everything inside. The outer eye ring is the same shade of purple I wanted to emphasize in the beak; so those two elements somewhat reinforce each other. 

## The Scales

My original intent was to make it look like Amabie's body was covered in scales, similar to a fish. I was unable to achieve the proper *layered* effect you see when looking at scales, and instead it kinda looks like Rainbow Ice Dippin Dots.

Though techinically a fail, I really like how the body came out.

First

I was literally blown away when I saw what everyone else had made. 

Before I continued scrolling down the page to view the designs crafted by IDEO designers I made an EXCELLENT decision, and immediately designed my Amabeia **before** continueing with the rest of the article, because I didn't want to
