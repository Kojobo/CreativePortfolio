I came across this 'challenge' while parousing through IDEO's blog (The Octopus) and thought it would be fun to design a supernatural entity with a few constraints tied in. 

The design was made on a generation 1 iPad pro using the original Apple pencil and an app called Notability. 

The IDEO article is about a mythical sea creature from Japanese folklore, named Amabie. The 'challenge' element of this story is to come up with an idea for what Amabie looks like, provided a list of three constraints. The rules are that your Amabie must include: 

1. A Beak
2. Long-Hair
3. Fin-like Wings

> "The rest is up to the artist" 

After reading the instructions, I immediately started working on my Amabie design; I waited to read the rest of the article until *after* I finished my design, because I thought that the designers creations might unintentionally influence my Amabie's design. 

I'm so glad that I did this. 
Here is my design.

I spent a long time debating the ins and outs of each of these parameters. 

I went with a cool-color palette to emphasize Amabie's connection to the sea, and brightness of the palette is supposed to reinforce Amabie as a beacon of hope. I wanted it to look as if they were glow-in-the-dark, like an angler fish or something else from the deep. 

## A Beak

I tried to emulate the shape of those long nosed masks people wore during the black plague, because Amabie is somehow tied to disease and public health. Instead of making it black, I wanted the beak to be a bit *loud*, like a toucan's, so I used more of a neon/electric palette and decided on purple as the base color. I like how it turned out, but it also kinda reminds me of a Wild Berry Poptart.

I also like that the pattern gives the beak a more of a 3D vibe.

I also considered squid beaks for a moment, instead of a bird beak, but those are mainly internal so you wouldn't be able to see it. 

I think if I were to make Amabie again I might follow through with the squid beak and go with more of a cephalapod vibe. I could draw something similar to a squid, and include the other parameters without making the beak expressly visible, the way you might see a normal squid. I didn't think of that at first,but now that I'm thinking about it again while typing this post I'm having the realization that just because I have something doesn't mean that it *must* been seen or on display. I have a brain, but you can't see it; Amabie can have a beak, and we don't have to see it to believe it. 

### The Eye

This wasn't one of the requirements, but I knew I wanted to make the eye a main feature in the design because Amabie is able to see into the future. I used a fisheye as a reference, but instead of having a large black pupil, I made it absurdly large and white to somewhat allude to Amabie's power to see the future.  The Iris is mainly blue, but its got a little bit of everything inside. The outer eye ring is the same loud purple as the beak's; so those two elements somewhat reinforce each other. 

### The Scales

My original intent was to make it look like Amabie's body was covered in scales, similar to a fish. I was unable to achieve the proper *layered* effect you see when looking at scales, and instead it kinda looks like Rainbow Ice Dippin Dots.

Though techinically a fail, I really like how the body came out. I made the scales slightly transparent in attempt to make them blend a bit better. An unintended side effect was that Amabie became somewhat see-through, similar to a jellyfish. I didn't notice it until I changed the background color.

Things got real weird with this background..

## Fin-like Legs
I used a beta fish as inspiration for the *fin-like legs*; they were initially much more flowy but I trimmed them down and made them resemble some sort of bell bottoms you'd see on Saturday Night Fever.

About halfway into designing the legs, I realized that the prompt never stated the gender of Amabie. My initial initial thought after reading the prompt was that Amabie gave off more of a female vibe, but I tried to steer towards more of a gender neutral design. 



## Long Hair

This was honestly the hardest restraint for me. Hair isn't typically something you see when dealing with creatures of the sea, so I puzzled over this one for quite a bit. Eventually I went with a single strand of hair on the top of their head because it seemed funny to have this ghost-like entity with a giant hair poking up. 

## Arms

This was the final element I added because I wasnt sure how to make arms that didn't cover up what I had already drawn. To be honest, I almost didnt add arms because I didn't know what to make. I started with the same general idea that I used to make the legs (ie betafish) but then tried to make them much more flowy. I was aiming for something that looked somewhat like giant baggy sleeves, but I think they look more like a pair of Victoria Secret Wings. 

Although I used the same color for the arms and the single hair on the head, I'm sticking to the initial idea that the only hair Amabie has is on their head. Whatever she's got for arms, it is not hair. It may look like hair, but I assure you, it isn't. 

I was literally blown away when I saw what everyone else had made. 

Before I continued scrolling down the page to view the designs crafted by IDEO designers I made an EXCELLENT decision, and immediately designed my Amabeia **before** continueing with the rest of the article, because I didn't want to 

## Becoming a Meme

I can't really think of any contexts where Amabie would be deemed meme-worthy. However there are people out there that have a much richer understanding of meme culture that might be able to do something with it. 

### Amabie vs. Old Gregg

Brainstorming meme ideas eventually led me to thinking about a different mythical sea creature with long hair: Old Gregg. If you've never seen or heard of Old Gregg, boy are you in for a treat. Old Gregg is a mythical sea creature that appears in Season 2, Episode 5 of **The Mighty Boosh**, a very trippy British TV comedy. The character is played by Noel Fielding, a popular British comedian and my favorite co-host on the Great British Bake Off.
