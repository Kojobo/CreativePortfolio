Anthem is a massive company by any measure, but they weren't always this size. Anthem grew to its current size by acquiring and merging with a long list of health plans across the country.

Anthem's rapid expansion benefited the company in many ways, but it also created some problems. 

One problem was that the businesses Anthem absorbed *rarely* used the same software as Anthem. Even if they did use the same software, they almost never had the same role titles and responsibilities as their new parent company. This made Anthem operate less like a single cohesive company, and more like a conglomeration of smaller businesses. As a result, it was more difficult to collect and communicate data across the company. These differences were particularly noticeable in sales, and Anthem intended to fix this problem by getting everyone on the same software platform: SalesForce. Before Anthem could deploy the new Saleforce system, they needed to figure out the best way to go about doing sales - basically *who* should be involved in the process and *what* should they be doing. To determine the best sales method, Anthem needed to understand the current methods being used. 

The task of mapping out each state's sales process, and the subsequent development of a universal process was assigned to a team of Anthem's Internal Consultants. 

I was a member of this team while I interned at Anthem back in the summer of 2018.
