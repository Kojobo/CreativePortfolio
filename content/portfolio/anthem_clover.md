In 2018 I spent the summer in Denver, Colorado interning with Anthem Inc. as an internal consultant. For my main project, I was part of a team of other internal consultants whose main goal was to map out Anthem's current sales practices and design a uniform sales process that would be implemented company-wide. To better understand the inherent complexity of this project, it helps to know a few things about Anthem.

### Some Background on Anthem Inc.

Anthem Inc. is one of the largest companies in the US: in 2020, Anthem Inc. ranked 29 on the Fortune 500 and 68 on the Global 500. More specifically, Anthem is one of the largest health benefits companies in the US, providing various forms of coverage to 41 million insured members in 23 states and DC.

Anthem is a massive company by any measure, but they weren't always this big. Initially, Anthem only provided coverage in a single state: it became the healthcare behemoth it is today by acquiring and merging with a long list of health plans across the country.

Anthem's rapid expansion benefited the company in many ways, but it also created some problems.

One problem was that the businesses Anthem absorbed *rarely* used the same software as Anthem. Even if they did use the same software, they almost never had the same role titles and responsibilities as their new parent company. This made Anthem operate less like a single cohesive company, and more like a conglomeration of smaller businesses. This was particularly problematic for Anthem's sales department because it was difficult to collect and communicate data across the company. Essentially the software platforms created a technological barrier that prevented sales teams in different states from working together.

Anthem intended to fix this problem by getting every sales team to use the same software and sales processes. Before the sales teams in each state could convert to this new universal system, Anthem needed to develop a new, universal system. To develop such a system, they needed to understand what the current sales process looked like in each state. After mapping out the sales process for each state, the team would take the best parts from each of these processes and combine them into a universal process.

 basically *who* should be involved in the process and *what* should they be doing.

### Breaking Down the Sales Process

The process starts with a Broker - they bring in potential new clients (PNC). The PNC fills out an application and Anthem's sales team uses the information to generate a quote. The process ends when members receive their insurance cards. A lot happens between these two events. Each state processes sales, but they each have a slightly different method for getting from Point A to Point B. 

For a long time, healthcare work was done in hardcopy format; everything was printed and processed on paper. Anthem wanted/needed to make the transition from doing business on paper to  doing it electronically.

Each state had its own set of healthcare laws - their own set of legal hoops you need to jump through to conduct business in that state. Some of these nuanced statutes have a significant impact on the way things get done (or undone).

Technology also varies state to state - there are three main regions (west, midwest, northeast) each of which uses different software to process sales. Although, two states that use the same software don't necessarily have the same roles and responsibilities.
