      <description>In addition to making graphics, I like to make other things as well.
Here are a few things that I&#39;ve made.
Wall Art This is an origami piece made from cardstock.
The piece on the left was designed using Cricut Design studio, and the piece on the right is a version made from cardstock.
Wedding Backdrop In September 2019, my mom and I made this backdrop for a family wedding. The flowers were cut using a Cricut and are made out of cardstock and old jewelry.</description>
