         <h1>Anthem</h1>
         <p>In 2018 I spent the summer in Denver, Colorado interning with Anthem Inc. as an internal consultant. For my main project, I was part of a team whose main goal was to map out Anthem's current sales practices and design a uniform sales process that would be implemented company-wide.</p>
<p>To better understand the inherent complexity of this project, it helps to know a few things about Anthem.</p>
<h3 id="some-background-on-anthem-inc">Some Background on Anthem Inc.</h3>
<p>Anthem Inc. is one of the largest companies in the US. In 2020, Anthem Inc. ranked <strong>29th on the Fortune 500</strong> and <strong>68th on the Global 500</strong>.</p>
<p>More specifically, Anthem is one of the largest health benefits companies in the US, providing coverage to 41 million insured members in 23 states and Washington DC.</p>
<p><img src="/portfolio/anthem_clover_files/anthem_coverage.jpg" alt="Anthem's Coverage"></p>
<p>Anthem is a massive company by any measure, but it wasn't always this big: it became the health care behemoth it is today by acquiring and merging with a long list of health plans across the country.</p>
<p>![Anthem Expansion ](/portfolio/anthem_clover_files/anth_ipad.2020-09-21 07_53_07.gif)</p>
<p>Anthem's rapid expansion benefited the company in many ways, but it also created some problems.</p>
<p>One problem was that the businesses Anthem absorbed <em>rarely</em> used the same software as Anthem. Even when these newly acquired companies <em>did</em> use the same software, they almost never had the same role titles and responsibilities as their new parent company. This made Anthem operate less like a single cohesive company, and more like a conglomeration of smaller businesses.</p>
<p>This was particularly problematic for Anthem's sales department because it was difficult to collect and communicate data across the company. Essentially the multitude of different software platforms created a technological barrier that prevented sales teams in different states from working together.</p>
<p>Anthem intended to fix this problem by developing a centralized sales system so that every state's sales team was aligned using the same software and sales processes. To develop such a system, they needed to understand the current sales process in each state. After mapping out each state's process, the team would take the best parts from each of these processes and combine them into a universal process.</p>
<h3 id="anthems-ideal-sales-format">Anthem's Ideal Sales Format</h3>
<p>Before surveying states to collect sales data, the team developed a rough idea of an <em>ideal</em> sales process - basically, it laid out <em>who</em> should be involved in the process and <em>what</em> should they be doing. This served as an initial guide for developing the final sales process later on.</p>
<p>The initial sales process consisted of five main roles, each with a set list of responsibilities.</p>
<p><img src="/portfolio/anthem_clover_files/anthem_ideal_sales_people.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Together, resources from these five roles complete the various steps required to process a wide range of sales related tasks. For example, the process for adding a potential new client might look like this:</p>
