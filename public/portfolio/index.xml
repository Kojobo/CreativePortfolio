      <description>&lt;p&gt;When she reached the first hills of the Italic Mountains, she had a last view back on the skyline of her hometown Bookmarksgrove, the headline of Alphabet Village and the subline of her own road, the Line Lane.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and Consonantia, there live the blind texts. A small river named Duden flows by their place and supplies it with the necessary regelialia. It is a paradisematic country, in which roasted parts of sentences fly into your mouth.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>RGB</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a graphic I made to help me learn RGB color codes. The color spectrum can be divided into six equal sections. Similar graphics exist but they typically used lines rather than solid shapes to represent the levels of Red, Blue and Green along the spectrum. Additionally, these graphics would overlay the Red Blue and Green lines on top of each other, which made it difficult to see the level of any one color.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
