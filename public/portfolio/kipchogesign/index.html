         <h1>Chicago Marathon 2019</h1>
         <p>The Chicago Marathon's official instagram account picked my race sign as one of the best at the entire race.</p>
<p>In 2019, my little brother ran in the Chicago Marathon. I made some signs for me and my family so that he could spot us in the crowd during the race. After the race, one of my signs was showcased by the official Chicago Marathon instagram account as one of the favorite signs of Chicago Marathon.</p>
<p>Making funny or witty race signs is a pretty popular sideline activity for spectators at these events. There are plenty of running websites that post signs from previous races that you can use as inspiration when making your own. After combing through these articles I realized that there were a dozen or so sign designs that kept being repeated race after race. I wanted to create something that the running world had never seen before, so instead of using these running articles as an example for what to make, I used them to determine what <em>not</em> to make.</p>
<p>After consulting my siblings and their significant others for sign ideas, I eventually settled on these four designs. Aside from the metallic letters, everything was made using a Cricut. Most of the letters were cut from cardstock, but I used vinyl for the font on the yellow sign because I had never used vinyl and we had it in our craft closet so I figured I'd give it a whack.</p>
<p><img src="/portfolio/6w_Kipchoge_files/chicago_all4.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>This was my favorite because you could change the numbers to say whatever number of miles the runners had left.</p>
<p><img src="/portfolio/6w_Kipchoge_files/chicago_E.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>My brother and I came up with this idea because we weren't sure where we were going to be watching the race, and we didn't know how many miles we would be from the finish line. So I made a full set of numbers and added velro to the back of each, so we could update the sign if we decided to watch  from different points along the racecourse.</p>
<p><img src="/portfolio/6w_Kipchoge_files/cool_like_kip.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>I made this design because Eliud Kipchoge is my brother's all-time favorite runner. Kipchoge usually participates in the Chicago Marathon, but this year he was unable to because he was over in Europe attempting to be the first human to ever complete a marathon in under two hours. I was aware of Kipchoge's previous attempt at breaking this record, and I knew that he was planning on making another. However, I had no idea that this world record attempt was scheduled to take place the same weekend as the Chicago Marathon. What's even crazier of a coincidence is that because he was doing his race over in Europe the time change made it so he successfully completed his run at like 2AM the night before the Chicago Marathon. So bascially everyone in the US woke up to news of Kipchoge making history, and it was all the running world was talking about. This unbelievable coincindence made my sign especially popular that day - people were walking up to me and asking if they could take pictures while holding the sign.</p>
<p>Here is a picture of me holding the sign in China Town. (it was very early)</p>

<p>Here is a picture of me and other members of my family holding up the signs I made.

<p>A couple weeks later, the official instagram account for the Chicago Marathon posted a story requesting submissions for the best signs from the race that year. I'm not sure who sent them a picture of my Kipchoge sign, but I was surprised and delighted when I saw that it was on their story. (though I wish they hadn't blacked me out)</p>
<p>![](/portfolio/6w_Kipchoge_files/Photo Feb 18, 2 31 18 PM.jpg)</p>
<p>The first post on the story was a message to all of the account's followers requesting submissions for their favorite signs from the 2019 marathon. The <strong>second</strong> post was technically when they started showcasing their favorite signs from the race. If you look closely, you'll notice that my sign was the second post on their story.</p>
<p>So, is it safe to assume that my sign was the <em>ultimate</em> favorite sign of the race because it was the first sign they posted to their story? Probably not..but I can definitely say that it was a sign than the running world had never seen before and I think nobody would challenge me if I said that it was <em>at least</em> in the Top 5.</p>
<p>The marathon itself was a fun experience. My family set up camp in Chinatown for most of the race and we got to explore the area a bit while we waited for my little brother to pass by (we were there for four hours and saw him for less than a minute). My highlight for the day was getting to experience a Chinese bakery for the first time. We bought just about every type of bun they had and everyone got to sample a little bit of everything. It was also nice to have people coming up and complimenting me on my sign, but it was even more exciting to be featured on the official Chicago Marathon's instagram account, which has nearly 100K followers from all around the world.</p>
