         <h1>Summer Reading 2020</h1>
         <p>A growing list of books I've been reading this summer.</p>
<p>I am a <strong>massive</strong> fan of books. Period.</p>
<p>I'm not the sort of person who completely reads a book from cover to cover before starting another book. Instead, I tend to <em>hop around</em> between multiple books simultaneaously and what I'm reading at any given time is based primarily on the current mood or vibe I'm looking for</p>
<p>These are some of the books that I've picked up this summer, and I fully expect this list to expand throughout the season.</p>

<h3 id="opt-art-from-mathematical-optimization-to-visual-design---robert-bosch">OPT ART: From Mathematical Optimization to Visual Design - Robert Bosch</h3>
<p>I recently went into a Barnes and Noble for the first time in months and stumbled across this book in the math section. That author uses advanced mathmematics to design unique iterations of artwork and walks the read through the steps to create your own. One program he uses applies the <em>Traveling Salesman</em> problem to connect a series of points to optimize whatever parameters to decide to incorporate.</p>
<p>This was one of the few books this summer that I actually read cover to cover before moving on to different book because I found it so fascinating. I would love to learn and use the software that he mentions in this book, but sadly some of the technology is not free and I no longer qualify for the free student trial.</p>

<h3 id="music-by-the-numbers---eli-maor">Music by the Numbers - Eli Maor</h3>
<p>This book was also from my recent trip to Barnes and Noble. I've only read the intro and some of the first chapter, but so far it's really interesting. The book compares the major changes in the world of Mathematics around the start of the 19th century with the major changes in the world of Music during the same time.</p>
<p><img src="/portfolio/Books_summer_files/summer_music.jpg" alt="Music by the Numbers "></p>
<h3 id="the-violinists-thumb---same-kean">The Violinist's Thumb - Same Kean</h3>
<p>Yet another find during my trip to Barnes and Noble; this book is written by one of my favorite authors, Sam Kean. Kean's first book, <em>The Disappearing Spoon</em>, was one of my favorite science books ever, so when I saw this on the shelf I knew I had to get it. <em>The Violinist'&lsquo;s Thumb</em> focuses on DNA and the scientists who grappled with its mysteries throughout history. It also touches on the fields DNA has direct applications, such as genetics and disease. If you enjoy science but don't want to read a textbook, these books are perfect for you.</p>
<p><img src="/portfolio/Books_summer_files/summer_violinist.jpg" alt="Violinist Thumb"></p>
<h3 id="it---stephen-king">IT - Stephen King</h3>
<p>I started reading this book back around the time the second IT movie came out. I continued working my way thought it for most of Octoboer and the Halloween season but once it became Christmas time I switched to reading some <em>lighter</em> material. I recently started reading this again because the story itself is set in the middle of the summer so it felt appropriate to come back to it. My favorite part about the book compared to the movie is that the book includes <strong>tons</strong> of detail that's not included in the movie. More specifically, the book goeto great lengths to describe <em>smells</em>: popcorn at the carnival, apple pie, rotting corpses, funky sewers flowing with &lsquo;gray water&rsquo;. Adding the sense of smell into the story really changes the way you think about what these kids are going through and makes you rethink what it would be like to encounter <strong>IT</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="/portfolio/Books_summer_files/summer_it.jpg" alt="IT ">]</p>
<h3 id="the-signal-and-the-noise---nate-silver">The Signal and the Noise - Nate Silver</h3>
<p>This was the last of the books I picked up on my Barnes and Noble trip, and it was a book that I've wanted for a long time. It's regularly recommended for MBA students and after reading the first few pages I understand why. This book is excellent at explaining the intricacies of statistics and how to properly apply them to real world situations. Silver walks through many common scenarios where statistics are used, and highlights many of the ways in which these statistics are used incorrectly. I'm only on chapter 3 but I'm looking forward to working my way through the rest.</p>
<p><img src="/portfolio/Books_summer_files/summer_signal.jpg" alt="Signal"></p>
<h3 id="proof---amir-alexander">Proof! - Amir Alexander</h3>
<p>I order this book because it was mentioned in one of my favorite math books of all time: <em>How Not to be Wrong: the Power of Mathematical Thinking</em> by Jordan Ellenburg. <em>Proof!</em> focuses on the history of geometry, and how it has had led to some rather interesting human interactions throughout history.</p>
<p><img src="/portfolio/Books_summer_files/summer_proof.jpg" alt="Proof">
<img src="/portfolio/Books_summer_files/books_hownottobewrong.jpg" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="flatland---edwin-a-abbott">Flatland - Edwin A. Abbott</h3>
<p>I found this book in a small local book store that used to be a church. I regularly saw <em>Flatland</em> on book lists for people who enjoy math, so I was excited to finally acquire it. Although this book is <em>very</em> short, it is definitely a tough read. It's a story about beings that live in a two dimensional world and challenges the reader to reimagine their perceptions of dimensions.</p>
<p><img src="/portfolio/Books_summer_files/summer_flatland.jpg" alt="flatland"></p>
<h3 id="a-midsummer-nights-dream---william-shakespeare">A Midsummer Night's Dream - William Shakespeare</h3>
<p>I read this book back in 8th grade and I remember enjoying it because it was one of Shakespeare's <em>trippier</em> plays. It made its way onto my summer reading list because the story takes place during the summer, and because I was looking for something a bit more whimsical compared to all the math related books I was reading.</p>
<p><img src="/portfolio/Books_summer_files/summer_shakespeare.jpg" alt="shakespeare"></p>
<h3 id="marathon---hal-higdon">Marathon - Hal Higdon</h3>
<p>This book is a part of the summer reading  list because I'm signed up to run in the Nashville Rock n&rsquo; Roll half marathon in November. The race was originally scheduled for April, but a tornado ripped through the city just prior to race day, and there were concerns about the corona virus. The race reschedule added 9 months or so to my training regimen, and I'm using this book to design that regimen.</p>
<p><img src="/portfolio/Books_summer_files/summer_marathong.jpg" alt="Higdon"></p>
<h3 id="charlie-and-the-great-glass-elevator">Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator</h3>
<p>I've had this book for years but never got around to reading it until now. I recently watched <em>Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory</em> (the original with Gene Wilder) and it reminded me that I had this book, which is the sequel to the original story. I'm a big fan of Roal Dahl's work and this book is no exception. Charlie and his family travel with Mr. wonka through space in the Great Glass Elevator and encounter all sorts of stuff along the way.</p>
<p><img src="/portfolio/Books_summer_files/summer_charlie.jpg" alt="Wonka"></p>
<h3 id="the-demon-haunted-world-science-as-a-candle-in-the-dark---carl-sagan">The Demon Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark - Carl Sagan</h3>
<p>My brother bought me this book a while ago and I've struggled to read it. I enjoy Carl Sagan and his work, but this is my first time reading any of this writing. Sagan uses a somewhat techinical writing style which makes it hard to follow along at times, so I can only read this book in short sprints.</p>
<p><img src="/portfolio/Books_summer_files/summer_sagan.jpg" alt="Sagan "></p>
<h3 id="call-me-by-your-name---andre-aciman">Call Me by Your Name - Andre Aciman</h3>
<p>This is definitely my guilty pleasure book on this list. I saw the movie once or twice and enjoyed the story (as well as Timonthee Chalamet). Eventually this book was chosen for  one of my book clubs and I still read it occasionally during the summer when I want to relax and enjoy the season similar to the characters in the book. The author is also very good at putting the complex thoughts of love into words.</p>
<p><img src="/portfolio/Books_summer_files/summer_callmebyyourname.jpg" alt="Call me by your name"></p>
<h3 id="the-great-gatsby---f-scott-fitzgerald">The Great Gatsby - F. Scott Fitzgerald</h3>
<p>This book made the list because of its size: Gatsby is a very short book and I needed something to bring with me when my family drove out to the lake one day. The story also takes place during the summer so it felt appropriate to read it now. I definitely appreciate many Fitzgeralds writing devices, but there are times where it appears that he was trying too hard to make some profound statement and the attempt just didn't land. Either way, it was an enjoyable read and I can understand why many consider it one of the best works of American literature.</p>
